  R12B-5 is the recommended version. Support for R13B is experimental.


   Upgrading From ejabberd 1.x.x:

- Check the Release Notes of the intermediate versions for additional
  information about database or configuration changes.


   Upgrading From ejabberd 2.0.x:

- The database schemas didn't change since ejabberd 1.1.4.
  Anyway, it is recommended to backup the Mnesia spool directory and
  your SQL database (if used) before upgrading ejabberd.

- The plugin of mod_pubsub "default" is renamed to "flat". You need
  to edit the ejabberd configuration file and replace those names.

- The listener options 'ip' and inet6' are not documented anymore
  but they are supported and you can continue using them.
  There is a new syntax to define IP address and IP version.
  As usual, check the ejabberd Guide for more information.

- The log file sasl.log is now called erlang.log

- ejabberdctl commands now have _ characters instead of -.
  For backwards compatibility, it is still supported -.

- mod_offline has a new option: access_max_user_messages.
  The old option user_max_messages is no longer supported.

- If you upgrade from ejabberd trunk SVN, you must execute this:
  $ ejabberdctl rename_default_nodeplugin

- Default installation directories changed a bit:
  * The Mnesia spool files that were previously stored in
      /var/lib/ejabberd/db/NODENAME/*
    are now stored in
      /var/lib/ejabberd/*
  * The directories
      /var/lib/ejabberd/ebin
      /var/lib/ejabberd/priv
    and their content is now installed as
      /lib/ejabberd/ebin
      /lib/ejabberd/priv
  * There is a new directory with Erlang header files:
      /lib/ejabberd/include
  * There is a new directory for ejabberd documentation,
    which includes the Admin Guide and the release notes::
      /share/doc/ejabberd

- How to upgrade from previous version to ejabberd 2.1.0:
  1. Stop the old instance of ejabberd.
  2. Run 'make install' of new ejabberd 2.1.0 to create the new directories.
  3. Copy the content of your old directory:
       /var/lib/ejabberd/db/NODENAME/
     to the new location:
       /var/lib/ejabberd/
     so you will have the files like this:
       /var/lib/ejabberd/acl.DCD ...
  4. You can backup the content of those directories and delete them:
       /var/lib/ejabberd/ebin
       /var/lib/ejabberd/priv
       /var/lib/ejabberd/db
  5. Now try to start your new ejabberd 2.1.0.
